acme-git
========
A git tool for the Acme editor.

DESCRIPTION
----------- 
The acme-git tool wraps a few common git commands in an Acme window.
The available commands are mainly displaying raw git output with the 
exception of the Status command which displays a list of readily available 
git commands based on the files' status.

The following plumbing rule can be used to show the content of a commit from the `git log` output:
	type	is	text
	data	matches	'commit ([a-zA-Z0-9]+)'
	plumb	start	rc -c 'git -C '$wdir' show '$1' | plumb -w '$wdir' -d edit -a ''action=showdata filename=+'$1''' -i'
